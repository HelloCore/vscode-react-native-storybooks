# React Native Storybooks

Adds a command to inline show the Storybook page inline inside VS Code. 

Basically jams http://localhost:9001 into a tab that you can have on the side.

## Features

* Doesn't quite fit initially - you'll have to resize it, there's no extension API for width
* Gets a bit conflict-y if you still have the page open in   
* Does work though!
* So, you got that.

## Known Issues

Nothing critical ATM.
