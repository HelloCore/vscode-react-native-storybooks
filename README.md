## How do I use it?

Install it, ensure that the configuration is right. You should see a new section under the files in the Explorer panel called "Storybook".

If your react-native server crashes, use the command "Reconnect Storybook to VS Code" to re-connect.

## Configuration

 - `react-native-storybooks.host`: string (default: "localhost")
 - `react-native-storybooks.port`: number (default: 9001)

You can either change these in your user settings, or per-project you can create a `.vscode/settings.json` file and add them there.

## Known Issues

Nothing critical ATM.
